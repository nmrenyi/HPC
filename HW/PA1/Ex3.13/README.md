# Problem
1. is it necessary to bcast the displacement and the data_count? or just let each process know its own displacement and data_count?

2. write a duipai program between serial and parallel

3. make more clear about the makefile, such as parametre passing, different environment(cluster and pc), naming rules, etc.

4. what is sending sig_INT to mirun in output.txt2 (duipai parallel output?)
